Code Issues

<ul class="review">
  <li>
  Needs a comment specifying why is 768 specifically used for <code>if (width >= 768)</code> on line 5.
  </li>
  <li>
  If the value 768 may change in the future, recommend putting 768 in a variable with a meaningful variable name of what
  the value represents to make the code easier to understand and modify.
  </li>
  <li>
  Why is the <code>resize</code> function called twice? <code>resize</code> is first called with a 
  function as a parameter on line 3, and then <code>resize</code> is called again with no parameter on line 11.
  Needs a comment explaining the reason behind calling <code>resize</code> twice.
