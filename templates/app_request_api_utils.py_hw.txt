Code Issues
</h3>

	<ul class="review">
		<li>
    It is unclear what is the difference between the <code>previous_value</code>
    and <code>new_value</code> in function
    <code>create_request_info_event()</code>.
		We know that the function updates events object request information.
		It is difficult to understand in this file what part of information of the
		events these values represent and what is the need of both the values.
		Though it becomes more clear in the <code>views.py</code> file that it is
		trying to update the agency title and agency request summary privacy
		options, a short summary can be given in this file itself maybe in the
		docstring.
