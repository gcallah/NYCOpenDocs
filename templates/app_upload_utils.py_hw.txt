  Use of module subprocess is associated with security implications (line 9).
  It is normally avoided unless used cautiously.

  Also, use of assert detected on line 144 and 146.
  The use of assert is also considered as general bad practice
  in OpenStack codebases.
  <p>
  Instead, a simple if condition can be used.
  <pre>
  <code>
  if not condition:
      raise AssertionError()
  </code>
  </pre>
  </p>
  </li>

</ul>
