Code Issues
</h3>

<ul class="review">
  <li>
  For the functions <code>edit_user_request</code> and <code>remove_user_request</code>, a temporary variable <code>tmp</code>
  on lines 130, 145, 191, and 204, is being used to store the return value of sending an email. However, that variable is not being used elsewhere after storing
  the return value. Recommend removing that temporary variable if that return value of sending an email will not be used.
  </li>
</ul>
