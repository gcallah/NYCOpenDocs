Code Issues
</h3>

<ul class="review">
  <li>
  A general docstring is missing explaining the use of the file.<br>
  The append function used in the <code>for</code> loop for
  <code>data_from_dates.append()</code> and <code>all_data.append()</code> is
  appending the same list of variables. The list is long and is adding more lines
  to the code. It can be defined once and that variable can be called in both the
  append functions. This will also help in reducing a chance of missing on any
  variable in the list.
