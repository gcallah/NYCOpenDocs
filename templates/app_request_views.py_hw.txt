<h3>
Code Issues
</h3>

	<ul class="review">
		<li>
			The request route decorator should be explained so that someone coming to this code
			for the first time knows what it is doing. (One comment for first decorator is enough.)
		</li>

		<li>
			Function <code>new()</code> is very long (over 100 lines). Should be broken up
			into smaller units for readability and unit testing.
		</li>

		<li>
			<code>view_all()</code> has no docstring. Also, why does it need a holiday list?
			Not saying it doesn't, just saying it is not explained.
		</li>

		<li>
			This <code>if</code> is hard to follow because huge:
			<pre>
			<code>
		if current_user in current_request.agency_users \
            or current_request.agency_request_summary \
            and (current_request.requester == current_user
                 and current_request.status == request_status.CLOSED
                 and not current_request.privacy['agency_request_summary']
                 or current_request.status == request_status.CLOSED
                 and current_request.agency_request_summary_release_date
                 and current_request.agency_request_summary_release_date
                 &lt; datetime.utcnow()
                 and not current_request.privacy['agency_request_summary']):
			</code>
			</pre>
			Recommend writing a predicate like <code>show_agency_req()</code>
			and placing all conditions in there.
		</li>

		<li>
			Lines 308-329 should be replaced by an attempt to get the
			value from the dictionary with a default of <code>False</code>.
			(<a href="https://docs.quantifiedcode.com/python-anti-patterns/correctness/not_using_get_to_return_a_default_value_from_a_dictionary.html">See here</a>.) 
		</li>
