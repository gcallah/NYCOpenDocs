Code Issues

<ul class="review">
  <li>
  Missing docstring for <code>send_async_email(msg)</code>
  </li>
  <li>
  Missing docstring for <code>send_contact_email(subject, recipients, body, sender)</code>
  </li>

  <li>
  Line 53 uses <code>assert</code>.
  <br>
  It was discovered that some projects used assert to enforce interface
  constraints. However, assert is removed with compiling to optimized byte
  code (python -o producing *.pyo files). This caused various protections
  to be removed. The use of assert is also considered as general bad practice
  in OpenStack codebases.
  <p>
  Instead a simple if condition can be used.
  <code>
  if not condition:
      raise AssertionError()
  </code>
  </p>
  </li>

</ul>
