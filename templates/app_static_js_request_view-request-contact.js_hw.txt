<ul class="review">
  <li>
  The format of this file looks very similar to <a href="https://github.com/CityOfNewYork/NYCOpenRecords/blob/master/app/static/js/request/contact.js">
  app/static/js/request/contact.js</a>. Both use the same <code>span</code> HTML element
  and have attributes being set multiple times for DOM elements. Recommend creating a separating JS file that this file and 
  <a href="https://github.com/CityOfNewYork/NYCOpenRecords/blob/master/app/static/js/request/contact.js">
  app/static/js/request/contact.js</a> can use, such as having a function that takes in a DOM element and an object of attributes 
  that are paired with their values.
