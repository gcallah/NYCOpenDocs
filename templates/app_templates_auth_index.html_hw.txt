If there are errors sent from the backend, they are first displayed. An alert for an unauthenticated user is also displayed. 

If a user is logged in, the user can view the attributes. Otherwise, the user needs to log in to access the attributes page. 

The user's status is displayed, whether the user is authenticated, anonymous, public, or an agency.

Could have a comment about what paint_logout is.
