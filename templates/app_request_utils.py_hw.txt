<h3>
Code Issues
</h3>

	<ul class="review">
		<li>
			The function <code>create_request</code> is over 200 lines long.
			It should be broken up into smaller functions for readability
			and unit testing.
			The numbered comments are the logical places to break up the code:
			turn each numbered comment into a function call.
		</li>

		<li>
			In the following code, the same call is being made in the
			<code>if</code> and the <code>else</code> with slightly different parameters:
			<pre>
			<code>
        if requester_email:
            safely_send_and_add_email(
                request.id,
                email_content,
                subject,
                to=[requester_email],
                bcc=bcc,
            )
        # otherwise send the email directly to the agency
        else:
            safely_send_and_add_email(
                request.id,
                email_content,
                subject,
                to=[agency.default_email],
            )

			</code>
			</pre>
			Instead, the parameters should be set in the <code>if</code>
			and the <code>else</code>, then the call made in one place.
		</li>

		<li>
			For the following line:
			<pre>
			<code>
				body = "Name: {} {}\n\nEmail: {}\n\nSubject: {}\n\nMessage:\n{}".format(
			</code>
			</pre>
			a constant string should be defined, to increase re-usability and ease possible
			ports to other languages.
		</li>

	</ul>
