  <li>
  On line 15, unnecessary semicolon is detected.
  JavaScript will more or less let you put semicolons after any statement
  without complaining.
  While not technically an error, extra semicolons can be a source of
  confusion when reading code.
  This is automatically fixable using the --fix flag on the command line.
