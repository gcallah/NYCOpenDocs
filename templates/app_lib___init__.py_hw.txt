This file contains the NYCHolidays class, extended from the HolidayBase class. When calling the _populate method, observed holidays are added to its list of holidays, such as Labor Day and Thanksgiving.
<br><br>
'holidays library' is used to determine whether a specific date is holiday or not in a particular country.<br>
Each country has two class names - an abbreviation and a full name.
Some holidays can be states specific as well.
<br><br>
'observed' param: (Default: True) <br>
January 1st, 2012 fell on a Sunday so the statutory holiday was observed on the 2nd. <br>
Therefore, January 2nd, 2012 gets included in the holiday list of that year.
<br><br>
>>> us_holidays.get(date(2012 ,1, 2))
<br>
"New Year's Eve (Observed)"
<br>
<br>
'expand' param: (Default: True) <br>
It is a boolean value specifying whether or not to append holidays in new years to the holidays object. <br>
This is set to False in function '_populate' meaning the Holiday object will no longer add holidays from new years. <br>
So, the function adds Dec 31st from the previous year without triggering the entire year to be added.
<br>
<br>
The file also checks the year since when the respective holidays are celebrated.
<br>
Example:<br>
New Year's Day since 1870, Columbus Day since 1970

Code Issues
</h3>

<ul class="review">
  <li>
  Needs a comment specifying how the class is used for the application
  </li>
  <li>
  Lines 22-25 looks confusing since <code>expand</code> is used to replace <code>self.expand</code>'s value of False, 
  which doesn't appear to be used.
  <br>
  <pre>
    <code>
    expand = self.expand
    self.expand = False
    self[date(year, 1, 1) + rd(days=-1)] = name + " (Observed)"
    self.expand = expand
    </code>
  </pre>
  Needs comments explaining what self.expand does - what does True and False mean for this attribute?
  </li>
</ul>
