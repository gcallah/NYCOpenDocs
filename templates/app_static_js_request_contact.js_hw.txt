Code Issues

  <li>
  The required data-parsley message for each DOM element have a repeated <code>span</code> HTML element. Recommend extracting
  the <code>span</code> HTML element into a variable. This can make it easier to read what the required message is 
  for name, email, subject, and message.
  <pre>
    <code>
    name.attr("data-parsley-required-message",
        "<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-exclamation-sign\"></span>&nbsp;" +
        "<strong>Error, a name is required.</strong> Please type in your name.");
    email.attr("data-parsley-required-message",
        "<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-exclamation-sign\"></span>&nbsp;" +
        "<strong>Error, an email is required.</strong> Please type in your email.");
    email.attr("data-parsley-type-message",
        "<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-exclamation-sign\"></span>&nbsp;" +
        "<strong>Error, this value should be an email.</strong> Please type in a valid email.");
    subject.attr("data-parsley-required-message",
        "<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-exclamation-sign\"></span>&nbsp;" +
        "<strong>Error, a subject is required.</strong> Please type in a subject name.");
    message.attr("data-parsley-required-message",
        "<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-exclamation-sign\"></span>&nbsp;" +
        "<strong>Error, a message is required.</strong> Please type in a message.");

  <li>
  Name, email, subject, and message have their attributes set three times. Recommend coding a function that takes in
  two parameters: the DOM element, such as name, and an object of attributes that pairs the attribute name with its 
  associated value.
