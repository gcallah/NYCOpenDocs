If file is not fully uploaded, the user cannot proceed to the next part of the form. Once the file form is validated, an array of files is created, with the matching privacy to each file.

Code Issues

<ul class="review">
    <li>
        For the first next button, at least 5 <code>if</code> statements are seen, but no <code>else</code> conditions. Recommend refactoring
        into different functions to make the event handler code easier to read and refactor to use <code>else</code> statements.
